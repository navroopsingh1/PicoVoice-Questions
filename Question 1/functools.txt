A simple approach is to use the lru_cache decorator from the functools library. This solves the problem but we are not really implementing it so I will also include a second approach where I implement the LRU cache myself.

********************************
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(N)
def get_book_info(isbn):
    pass
